\section{Introduction}

When performing a deformable image registration on medical images, the end
result we are often interested in is the spatial distribution of deformation.
In particular, we are most interested in the non-rigid deformations. That is,
we do not care as much about the rigid body translations, which often dominate
displacement field content, but the local stretching, compression, and
shearing that occurs. These quantities are quantified in the strain tensor,
which can be derived from the displacement field. The strain tensor is a
symmetric second rank tensor that is a function of derivatives of the
displacement field. It is a true tensor in that it is invariant to the
coordinate system that is used to specify its components.

Ellipsoids are often used to represent the symmetric second rank diffusion
tensor image when DTI is performed. The ellipsoid representation emerges
because of the equation

\begin{equation}
  \frac{x_1^2}{\lambda_1^2} + \frac{x_2^2}{\lambda_2^2} + \frac{x_3^2}{\lambda_3^2} = 1
  \label{eqn:ellipsoid}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_1 , \, \lambda_2, \, \lambda_3$ are the
eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor. This quadric representation of the
diffusion tensor is also the equation of an ellipsoid. With the ellipsoid
orientated by the eigenvectors and the stretching along each direction
determined by the eigenvalues, the ellipsoid succinctly represents the nine
components of the diffusion tensor.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{Sphere}
\itkcaption[Ellipsoid]{Glyph representation of a a second rank tensor when
  all the eigenvalues are positive, a ellipsoid, Eqn.~\ref{eqn:ellipsoid}.
When all the eigenvalues are equal, it represents a sphere.}
\label{fig:ellipsoid}
\end{figure}

In the past, ellipsoid glyphs have also been used to visualize strain fields.
Even though the strain tensor is also a real, symmetric second rank tensor,
the ellipsoid representation is not strictly appropriate. Unlike the diffusion
tensor, the eigenvalues of the strain tensor are not always positive. The
physical nature of diffusion and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics guarantee that
the eigenvalues will always be positive. In the case of strain, a negative
eigenvalue physically corresponds to compression in that direction, and a
positive eigenvalue corresponds to stretching or tension in that direction.

When there is one negative eigenvalue,

\begin{equation}
  \frac{x_1^2}{\lambda_1^2} + \frac{x_2^2}{\lambda_2^2} - \frac{x_3^2}{\lambda_3^2} = 1
  \label{eqn:onesheet}
\end{equation}

The representation is a hyperboloid of one sheet.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{OneSheetedHyperboloid}
\itkcaption[One-sheeted hyperboloid]{Glyph representation of a a second rank tensor when
  one eigenvalue is negative, a hyperboloid, Eqn.~\ref{eqn:onesheet}. The
  sheet extends infinitely, but it is truncated here at an extent where it has
  the same surface area as the corresponding sphere in Fig.~\ref{fig:ellipsoid}.}
\label{fig:onesheet}
\end{figure}

With two negative eigenvalues, the respresentation is a hyperboloid of two sheets.

\begin{equation}
  - \frac{x_1^2}{\lambda_1^2} - \frac{x_2^2}{\lambda_2^2} + \frac{x_3^2}{\lambda_3^2} = 1
  \label{eqn:twosheet}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{TwoSheetedHyperboloid}
\itkcaption[Two-sheeted hyperboloid]{Glyph representation of a a second rank tensor when
  two eigenvalues are negative, a hyperboloid, Eqn.~\ref{eqn:onesheet}. The
  sheet extends infinitely, but it is truncated here at an extent where it has
  the same surface area as the corresponding sphere in Fig.~\ref{fig:ellipsoid}.}
\label{fig:onesheet}
\end{figure}

\section{VTK Implementation}

VTK classes were created to generate hyperboloid\'s of one and two sheets,
\code{vtkOneSheetedHyperboloidSource} and
\code{vtkTwoSheetedHyperboloidSource}.  A
new tensor glyph class, \code{vtkSignedEigenvalueTensorGlyph} was created
to use the appropriate glyph based on the
sign of the input second rank tensor eigenvalues. The glyph is scaled
according to the eigenvalue magnitudes and oriented in the direction of the
eignvectors.

Table~\ref{tab:signed-flavors} shows how glyph appearance for different sets
of eigenvalues.  We see not only the orientation and magnitude, but the sign,
i.e.\ tensor or compression, is immediately distinuishable. This contrasts
with Table~\ref{tab:unsigned-flavors}, where the usual \code{vtkTensorGlyph}
is applied.  The pattern is: if a line through a given axis does not
intersect the glyph, there was compression in that direction.

When all three eigenvalues are negative, it is the equation for an "imaginary
ellipsoid".  Imaginary ellipoids are hard to draw (!), so a cube was used
instead.

\section{Uniaxial Loading}

Examining uniaxial loading can illustrate glyph behavior and provide insight
into the expected glyph content. Fig.~\ref{fig:uniaxialtension} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:uniaxialcompression} illustrate a mechanical model of a uniform,
solid block being compressed or stretched with an unconstrained set of plates.
There is no difference between tension and compression for the ellipsoid-only
representation, while the difference is clear with the hyperboloids.  This,
the simplest of mechanical models, illustrates typical material behavior:
because the Poisson effect, compression along one direction of the material
usually naturally generates expansion in the orthogonal directions.
Similarly, tension along one direction usually generates contraction in
orthogonal directions. In the case of the strain tensor, the material is
usually in a state of eigenvalues with varying signs.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{UniaxialTension}
\itkcaption[Uniaxial Tension]{Uniaxial tension of a block and the corresponding strain tensor
glyphs, unsigned on the left and signed on the right.}
\label{fig:uniaxialtension}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{UniaxialCompression}
\itkcaption[Uniaxial Compression]{Uniaxial compression of a block and the corresponding strain tensor
glyphs, unsigned on the left and signed on the right.}
\label{fig:uniaxialcompression}
\end{figure}

The amount of orthogonal response in response to unconstrained loading,
quantified as Poisson's ratio, is a property of the loaded material.
Incompressible materials have a Poisson's ratio of 0.5, while compressible
materials have a smaller Poisson's ratio. While it is physically and
mathematically possible to have a material with a negative Poisson's ratio
\cite{Lakes1987,Lakes1988} (all positive eigenvalues), this situation is
rare. In the uncontrained case, a material that compresses in all direction
(has all negative eigenvalues) would be unstable. When examining strain
computed from incompressible or nearly incompressible materials, like soft
tissues, the appearance of cube glyph should indicate the presence of
unrealistic estimated deformations.


\section{Why Image Processing Papers must include Source Code, Images and Parameters }

Modern Image Processing is most of the time performed with computers. An
attempt to replicate the results of an algorithm described in a paper entails
to reimplement the algorithm into source code. This task is far from trivial
and consumes months of work. The final result can not be guarranted to be
equivalent to the actual code that was used for testing the algorithm when the
paper was written, and therefore it cannot be considered a baseline for
comparing the algoritm with other algorithms availble to the reader.

Papers to the Insight Journal are written in the spirit of facilitating and
encouraging readers to perform replication of work. In this sense, the Insight
Journal is compliant with essential concepts of the scientific method.

Since the code is included with the paper, less time has to be spent in
describing the code, and more time can be used for describing how to use the
algorithm in particular types of images.

For questions on the basis of the scientific method the reader is refered to
\cite{Popper2002,Popper1971}.



\section{Pointing to other material}

The format of this LaTeX file, allows authors to include code snippets, like
the following

\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef itk::Image< unsigned char, 3 > ImageType;

ImageType::Pointer image = ImageType::New();
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

and to cite the online documentation of the Insitght Toolkit, for example, the
link to the doxygen documentation of the ImageToImageFilter

\doxygen{ImageToImageFilter}

LaTeX macros are also available for typesetting code in familiar courier fonts.
Like the following method of an ITK class.

\code{SetNumberOfIterations()}



% The preceding sections will have been written in a gentler,
% introductory style.  You may also wish to include a reference
% section, documenting all the functions/exceptions/constants.
% Often, these will be placed in separate files and input like this:



\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, use markup like
this:

\begin{verbatim}
\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, ....


\section{This is another}

Just add another \section{}, but don't say \appendix again.
\end{verbatim}
